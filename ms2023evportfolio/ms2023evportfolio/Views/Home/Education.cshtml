    The courses I completed  showcase a diverse spectrum of topics in the realm of information technology
    and systems administration. Starting with the foundational A+ certification, Network+ and CCNA Routing
    and Switching, I gained comprehensive insights into hardware, networking principles, and advanced
    routing and switching concepts. The course "Introduction to Mobile Device Support" equipped me with the
    skills needed to navigate the complexities of mobile technologies.</p>
    
    
<p> The proficiency in Windows 10 through the 70-697 and 70-698 exams honed my abilities in managing
    and troubleshooting Microsoft's flagship operating system. Moreover, I developed expertise in essential
    project management (Project+), effective communication in technology contexts, and time management
    strategies. The introduction to Windows PowerShell provided a toolkit for efficient system administration,
    while delving into Windows Server 2016 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2008-2016 furnished comprehensive 
    know-how in server management and email communication systems. This collection of courses has furnished
