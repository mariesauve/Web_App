<h3>Web Developer  (Student)</h3>
<h4>triOS College, Remote</h4>

<p>
    I'm pretty handy with WordPress, especially when paired up with Divi, Linux, SQL, XAMPP,
    and Apache. I've also had experience with Bootstrap projects, C# MVC, and ASP.NET. I love tackling
    tricky coding puzzles and creating smooth and visually striking user interfaces.

    When it comes to websites, I'm all about mixing cool features and design tricks. WordPress
    is my go-to for managing content in all sorts of ways, from making sure everything looks good
    on different devices to building solid backend systems. With these tools, I whip up digital
    experiences that will really click with users, no matter where they're browsing from.
